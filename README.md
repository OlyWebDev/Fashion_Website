This is a website about "Fashion Time Machine" through the 20th century. 
I've designed and developed it as a part of my final project in one of the web development classes in my degree. 
The styling was done using SASS and for more advanced interactions I've used javascript and jquery. Magnific-popup plugin was used for the gallery page.
