		<p>Victorian women in the beginning of 20th century were very conservative and traditional. They believed in women staying very womanly, dainty, and keeping their rolls in society. That was reflected in a fashion of that period. Before the flappers revolution women would dress corsets and long skirts, no makeup was allowed as well. Birthing children, cleaning, cooking, sewing, and caring are all they were seen as good for. They were strongly against women being rebellious to expectations, and protested to flappers as much as possible. Here is one of the well known quotes of that time: “Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a billingsgate fishwoman blush!” 
- Agatha Christie

			<p>1920 are known for one of the biggest fashion revolutions with a big influence on the future. Flappers of the 1920's were the women that were trying to break free from the mold of Victorianism. They believed in women doing whatever they wanted, and they did so. They smoked, drank, partied, cut their hair short, and wore what was considered inappropriate for the time. Their skirts often came above the knee, and their tops were low cut revealing themselves. On the other hand, these women were also trying to be able to get jobs that men had been doing since the beginning of time, such as lawyers, doctors, and other important rolls in the society. This was a great task to overcome, and was frowned upon. That being said, Flapper movement was very important in the developing of the individualization of women, and led women to be where they are today - independent and free. </p>
